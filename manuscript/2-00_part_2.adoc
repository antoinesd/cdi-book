= Part II - Basic CDI concepts

As we saw in part 1, CDI in itself is a specification, that is an abstract concept, or a set of abstract concepts, described in a paper document. Aside of this document, there are several implementations that are there to give life to this specification.

In this second part we'll detail all the basic concept fo the specification and show to use them.

In chapter 3 we'll introduce the concept of bean, bean definition and dependency injection.

Chapter 4 will cover the concept of bean Lifecycle, before we'll dive into context management in chapter 5.

Chapter 6 will deal with aspect oriented concepts with interceptors and decorators.

This basic CDI concept part will be closed in chapter 7 by discussing events.
