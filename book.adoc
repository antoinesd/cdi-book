= Contexts and Dependency Injection 2.0 in Action

Antoine Sabot-Durand <antoine@sabot-durand.net>



= Part 1 First step with CDI

== Introduction to CDI
=== Dependency injection
* The organization of classes, dependencies between classes
* Inheritance vs delegation, collaboration
* Why dependency injection got some attention
* Some pitfalls that make DI impossible to use (inh vs deleg)
* The question of testing : dependency injection makes the use of mocks so easy
* Dependency injection everywhere 
* Three ways to inject objects
* Discussion

=== What is CDI?
* Injection frameworks in Java (a little history : Fortress, Pico container, Hivemind, Spring)
* Dependency injection useful in the Java EE world, Java SE left aside (for now)
* Managed environment vs unmanaged : the need for a special object to handle the building of objects
* A first notion of container
* Injecting means producing

=== Problems solved by CDI
* Injection, interception, decoration, events : back to the roots

=== The CDI specification
* Talk a little about the way specifications appear in the Java EE world
* The structure of the specification
* Specification and TCK

=== CDI implementations
=== CDI and Java EE
=== Bootstraping CDI : Java SE, Web profile
=== Alternatives to CDI


== Getting started
=== Getting and installing Tools used in this book
=== CDI website and resources
=== Choosing your implementation
=== Using CDI with Java SE
* Bootstraping using Weld / OWB
=== Using CDI with Java EE
* Arquillian
=== Example, from scratch to full CDI

== The example Application
