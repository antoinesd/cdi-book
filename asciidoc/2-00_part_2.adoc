= Part II - Basic CDI concepts

Contains basic concept for CDI

== Getting started with CDI
	
=== Understanding the concept of “Bean”?

* Definition / metadata / instance
* Bean archive

=== Writing your minimal CDI application
	
* beans.xml with all
* Bootstrapping Weld

=== Defining a first CDI bean: choose your bean type

* @Produces / @Inject
* Works on the type
* Injection by field

=== Dealing with more than one bean per type

* Injection by identifier vs injecting by type
* @Qualifier @Typed
* @Alternative 
* @Specializes
* Using @Alternative to inject mock objets

=== Getting more flexibility with Programmatic lookup
	
* @Any
* Instance<T>
* AnnotationLiteral, TypeLiteral

=== Using @Stereotype to simplify @Alternative
=== Wrap-up


== Lifecycle
=== Why do you need a lifecycle?
	
* Notion of managed bean
* Definition of the life cycle in the context of CDI

=== Setting  up Callbacks on the bean lifecycle
=== Parallel with @Produces / @Disposes
=== Wrap-up


== Contexts

=== Understanding context?

* Contexts and scopes

=== See the contexts in action

* Request / Session / Application
* Conversation (tabbed navigation)
* Transaction
* Build your own context

=== Setting contexts with @Stereotype

=== Wrap-up

== Intercepting and decorating beans

=== Why do we need method interception?

* Security
* Logging
* Auditing


=== How interception differs from decoration
	
* Why do we need both?

=== How to set up interception
* Interception and contexts: transaction

=== How to set up decoration

=== Setting @Stereotype to intercept and decorate

=== Wrap-up

== Using events to decouple your application modules

=== Firing and observing events

=== Asynchronous events

=== Setting observers priority

=== Conditional observers

=== Transactional observers

=== Wrap-up
