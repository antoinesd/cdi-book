== Getting started with CDI

=== Understanding the concept of “Bean”?

* Definition / metadata / instance
* Bean archive

=== Writing your minimal CDI application

* beans.xml with all
* Bootstrapping Weld

=== Defining a first CDI bean: choose your bean type

* @Produces / @Inject
* Works on the type
* Injection by field

=== Dealing with more than one bean per type

* Injection by identifier vs injecting by type
* @Qualifier @Typed
* @Alternative
* @Specializes
* Using @Alternative to inject mock objets

=== Getting more flexibility with Programmatic lookup

* @Any
* Instance<T>
* AnnotationLiteral, TypeLiteral

=== Using @Stereotype to simplify @Alternative
=== Wrap-up
